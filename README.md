# Soulchat
Small tool to notify you of Soulseek private chats from the SoulseekQT or Nicotine+ clients.

# 04-24-2025: 
Pretty early WIP right now only works with the QT client and has basic functionality.
Need to update the config with your SMTP details. If using gmail all you need to change is the [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) and
the email you are sending and receiving to. The config file is currently expected to be at `/data/config.ini`
